# hello-world
Just another repo, my first actually ...

I've started working through the freecodecamp site in an effort to learn enough to start freelancing.  I've played with the WYSIWYG editors, but I always felt too constrained.  I decided I really need to just learn how to do it from scratch.  I think it will be much more satisfying.  Anyway,one thing led to another and here I am on Github.
